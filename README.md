## Description

Learning status code is important to both front-end developers and back-end developers. It is however a not pleasant process. How can we make it less boring and easy for the eyes? With cute cat images of course!

Purrfect Status is designed to make learning process easier and more fun. User can pick a cat picture they like, then link the status code and explanation they see fit to the image.
